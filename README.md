I choose to use the provided express web server in order to avoid cross-origin issue

I choose to use babel to transpile reactjs code (all the building process is launched and managed by webpack)

to run and test my application, you have to build the js code with ```npm run devbuild``` command then run the server ```npm start``` then you can acces the following url http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.

As I hadn't as much time as i would to work on this exercie, I haven't do any CSS 

Project source code can be found in the src/ folder. It is divided into 4 folders : actions/ - containing action creator (redux), cmp/ - for react components, reducers/ â€” composed with state reducers, and an api/ folder where ajax call are made

Hope it'll will fit yout requirments
